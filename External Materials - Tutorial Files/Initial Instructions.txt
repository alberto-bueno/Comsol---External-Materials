• 64-bit Windows with Microsoft Visual Studio:
	- from the Windows Start Menu.
		- Start Microsoft Visual Studio > Visual Studio Tools > Visual Studio x64 Win64 Command Prompt (2010) 
	- cd to the directory that contains your c file CODE.c.
	- "cl /MT /c CODE.c"
		- options: (access by typing: "cl /?")
			- /MT link with LIBCMT.LIB
			- /c compile only, no link
			- /MTd link with LIBCMT.LIB debug lib
	- "link /OUT:LIBRARY.dll /DLL CODE.obj"
		-options: (from link /?)
			- /OUT 
			- /DLL 
where:	
	- CODE.c is the name of your c code
	- LIBRARY.dll is whatever you want your .dll library to be named

Notes: 
The command prompt tool can be opened through the start menu (all applications -> visual studio -> tools)

To change disks, don't use cd command, just type the drive letter
(Changing C to A looks like -   C:\> A:\)

Help for the cl and link commands is obtained by typing /?
e.g. cl /? or link /?
