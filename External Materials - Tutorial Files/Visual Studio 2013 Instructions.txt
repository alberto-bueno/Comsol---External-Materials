Steps to create dynamic link libraries (.dll) using Visual Studio 2013

1) Download and install VS2013 
	-	we have free access to this through UCLA 
	-	log onto https://my.engineering.ucla.edu/
	-	select "Software Download" under the "My Tools" section on the left
2) Open VS2013
3) File -> New -> Project
4) Select Win32 Console Application from the Visual C++ list
5) Name the Project and Solution (ex: comsol_material)
	- select desired build location (or leave as default)
	- Leave "Solution:" as "Create new solution"
	- Ensure "Create directory for solution" is checked
	- Ensure "Add to source control" is not checked
6) Click "OK"
7) Application Wizard:
	- Overview: click next
	- Appliation Settings:
		-Application Type: DLL 
		- Additional Options (check): empty project, SDL
	- Click Finish
8) Create source file for project
	- In the Solution Explorer (usually on the left side), right click folder labeled "Source Files", add-> new item
	- Select a C++ (.cpp) file (leave name as Source.cpp)
	- Insert magical C++ code!
		- (for these instructions, view the source.cpp file included in the comsol_material folder)
	- The precompiler portion of these codes is crucial (region above EXPORT int eval()) 
		- the #ifdef section creates macros that specify commands to export functions from the library
		- the ifdef region should look like:
			#ifdef _MSC_VER									//Check if code is being compiled with visual studio 
			#define EXPORT extern "C" __declspec(dllexport)	//Define command to export symbols to a .dll
			#else
			#define EXPORT
			#endif		
		- extern "C" is used in the macro to prevent name mangling of the functions when the dll is compiled
		- Comsol looks specifically for a function called "eval" when it calls the external material library
9) When finished typing the code, select/highlight the "Solution 'comsol_material'" at the top of the Solution Explorer (left hand pane)
	- Open the Properties pane (hit F4)
	- Click the wrench icon to open the Property Pages
	- Highlight: Configuration Properties
	- Select "Configuration Manager"
	- Change "Platform" to "<New...>"
	- New Platform: x64, click OK
	- Close Configuration Manager
	- Hit OK to close Property Pages
10) Build .dll
	- Menu: Build -> Build Solution (ctrl+shift+B)
	- As long as you didn't mess things up, it compiles!
11) Use comsol_material.dll in Comsol's External Materials interface
